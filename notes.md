-react-native transpile javascript with the javascript core which is safari engine to transpile javascript. But since ios already has it react native does not ship it to ios but it has to send it to android and this made android apps slower than ios apps. Now react-native created Hermes for android.

- there is no css in react native. we are not on the web. react native uses native mobile tools. so css we use in react native is built through javascript. it does not have pixels. all dimensions are unitless. for layour it uses flexbox automatically.
